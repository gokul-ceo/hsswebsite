            <h5>Cross Border Data Transfer</h5>
            <p>
              When conducting business, working on Sri Saravana projects, or
              implementing new processes or systems, an operation may require
              the transfer of personal information to other entities or third
              parties that are located outside of the Sri Saravana operation’s
              country of business. While permissible data transfer mechanisms
              are defined by applicable law or regulation, examples include:
            </p>
            <p>
              A data transfer agreement with the party who will access or obtain
              the personal information; notice to and/or approval from a
              country’s local data protection authority; or notice to and/or
              consent from the individual whose data is to be transferred.
            </p>
          </div>

              or “opt-out” of the Sri Saravana's use of personal information and
              is usually obtained by a “check box” or signature confirming the
              individual understands and agrees to the processing of their
              personal information. At times, express written consent from the
              individual may be required based on the information processing
              activity. Sri Saravana receives consent from individuals prior to:
            </p>

                party;
              </li>
              <li>

                the individual’s country of residence
              </li>

            <p>
              While the majority of questions and issues related to access can
              be handled quickly, complex requests may take more research and
              time. In such cases, issues will be addressed, or you will be
              contacted regarding the nature of the problem and appropriate next
              steps, within thirty working days.

            <p>

              complete a registration form, we will place a "cookie" on your
              computer, which helps us identify you more quickly when you

              most useful or interesting at our Website.
            </p>

              Most browsers permit you to refuse to accept a "cookie" offered by
              a Web site. You will not be denied access to view any part of the
              website on account of your refusal to accept a "cookie," but your
              transactions through this Website may be delayed/denied due to the
              reason we do not possess the basic information necessary to
